## Motivation
The motivation for `smktrans` was to develop a set of functions to estimate the transition probabilities among current, former and never smoking states (i.e. initiation, quitting and relapse) from repeat cross-sectional survey data.    

`smktrans` was created as part of a programme of work to estimate the health economic effects of tobacco trends, policies and interventions at the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), The University of Sheffield.  

## Usage

The **inputs** are:   

1. Several years of annual cross-sectional survey data on smoking.  
1. Estimates of long-term smoking relapse.  
1. Estimates of smoking related disease risk and mortality rates.   

The **processes** applied by the functions in `smktrans` implement calculations to estimate and forecast the transition probabilities to get them into a form that can be used in a model that simulated the population dynamics of smoking.   

The **output** of these processes are the probabilities of smoking initiation, quitting and relapse, stratified by age, period, sex and quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation. These data can be saved so that you don't need to run the estimation processes in `smktrans` each time you want to run a model that uses the estimated transition probabilities.    

## Installation
`smktrans` is currently available only to members of the project team - we are developing plans to make the code open access. To access you need to [sign-up for a GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/). You will then need to be added to the STAPM Gitlab project to gain access.   

Once that is sorted, you can the latest or a specified version from GitLab with:     

```{r gh_installation, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
#install.packages("getPass")
#install.packages("git2r")

devtools::install_git(
  "https://gitlab.com/stapm/r-packages/smktrans.git", 
  credentials = git2r::cred_user_pass("uname", getPass::getPass()),
  ref = "x.x.x",
  build_vignettes = FALSE # vignettes are better viewed on the website
)

# uname is your Gitlab user name

# ref = "x.x.x" is the version you want to install - change to the version you want e.g. "1.2.3"
# or leave blank for the latest version

# running this code should make a box pop up where you enter your GitLab password
```

Or clone the package repo locally and use the ‘install and restart’ button in the Build tab of RStudio. This option is more convenient when testing development versions.  

Then load the package, and some other packages that are useful. Note that the code within `smktrans` uses the `data.table::data.table()` syntax.  

```{r pkgs, eval = F}
# Load the package
library(smktrans)
```
